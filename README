g8 for jamming together a play20 app
=====================================

One challenge with scala is the proliferation of dsl's to automagically configure things, and finding the best lib to accomplish a goal (that is compiled for this version of scala, as a release, and available via sbt).

Here is my current best guess at a robust toolchain to quickstart.

The default settings for this project are

use improved sbt script
build.sbt: configure to build sbt with 2.10.0-RC1
build.properties: use sbt 0.12.1



net.virtualvoid.sbt.graph.Plugin.graphSettings
